Two interesting **classification** problems

# DATASETS
What are the datasets and why were they chosen
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/
1. Choose data with many features - high dimensionality
2. Choose data with many instances - large sample size
3. Skewed data - imbalanced classes ?

# large features and sample size

## EDA

#

1. how to retrieve your code, 
2. how to retrieve your data, 
3. how to retrieve the dependencies (libraries) for running your code, 
4. and how to run your code.

Implement command prompt execution of your code.

Training
Test
Validation

Include learning curves for training and validation accuracy and loss.

ROC/AUC curves for test data.

# Hyperparameter tuning
Atleast 2 for each algorithm
- DT: Pruning, which atteibute did you choose to split on?
- Boosting: # of Weak Learners
- NN: Hidden Layer Size (Width, Depth), describe which activation function you chose
- SVM: Kernel Type, atleast two kernel types
- KNN: K

# Model evaluation
Precision, Recall, F1, Accuracy, Confusion Matrix

Use SHAPS to explain the model
